# ParsePolisen

I made this project to learn to program with the Android platform. I was already familiar with Java but 
everything "Android" was new to me and this project helped me understand the fundementals of Android. 
Everything from Activitys and permissions to System resource optimization.

## What will the app do?

This app is looking at the RSS feed on the Swedish polices homepage and retrieves that information and displays it 
on a simple HTML viewer on your phone.
